# Windows Client for Entropia Flow extension

This is a Windows client to enable more features for the extension. It is optional to have it installed.

_This implementation in .NET is deprecated because it produces too large binaries (90MB), use the [neutralino](win-client-app/README.md) implementation instead._

Planned features:
- Read game log to get loot in real time
- Show extension Stream View as overlay
